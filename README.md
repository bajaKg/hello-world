# hello-world
An example of a repository.
Hello my firends, I am studying information technologies. Recently I got some extra time that whanna use for exploring technologies, methods and technics that I didn't have chance to see or use until now. So, I hope I will learn something new in this period, a hopefully I will be of use to others. Good luck to you... and me. ;)
